    TODO write unit tests for taxCalculator.calculate() by mocking the taxAmountValidator, taxRateRepository, as well as mocking static NumberUtils.scale() method
    After invoking the method, don't forget to the assertions as well as verifications.

    Example test cases:
        - taxAmountValidator throws no exception, taxRepository returns values.
        - taxAmountValidator throws exception.
